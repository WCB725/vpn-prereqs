The next step is to set a A profile without a VPN activated. This is so The computer will show you what it looks like Before you activate the VPN. Once done head to VPN Proton and set Up an account there to begin setting Up the VPN

</p> After going to the Proton VPN and setting it up it should change your location and IP Address making your connection more secure and creating a virtual tunnel for you.
