The next step is to set a A profile without a VPN activated. This is so The computer will show you what it looks like Before you activate the VPN. Once done head to VPN Proton and set Up an account there to begin setting Up the VPN



<p>


</p> After going to the Proton VPN and setting it up it should change your location and IP Address making your connection more secure and creating a virtual tunnel for you.

<br />  

If done Correctly you can go back and See your IP Address and Location has been changed showing you have succsefully created a VPN and now your internet connection would be more secure and safe from anyone trying to hack you or damage your internet connection
